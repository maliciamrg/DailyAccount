ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From [.market_licensing.]:
* default.properties
From [.market_licensing_library.]:
* aidl\
* aidl\ILicenseResultListener.aidl
* aidl\ILicensingService.aidl
* default.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In [.market_licensing_library.]:
* AndroidManifest.xml => market_licensing_library\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => market_licensing_library\src\main\assets
* lint.xml => market_licensing_library\lint.xml
* res\ => market_licensing_library\src\main\res
* src\ => market_licensing_library\src\main\java\
In [.market_licensing.]:
* AndroidManifest.xml => market_licensing\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => market_licensing\src\main\assets
* lint.xml => market_licensing\lint.xml
* res\ => market_licensing\src\main\res\
* src\ => market_licensing\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
